Ever thought playing survival with a 150+ mod modpack was too easy once you were well enough equipped? Then this modpack is for you. With
the perfectly refined additions of Iguana Tweaks, Special AI, MineTweaker 3 & The spice of Life making mobs both passive and hostile "different than normal";
requiring atleast 12 different food items and a longer tool progression tree with vanilla ones being useless apart from crafting (except shears).
While Minetweaker 3 changes recipes from the default to something more "realistic" in perspective of the pack making things "harder".

This 171 mod modpack is a challenge worthy of co-op atleast just to "survive" the first 7 ingame days without starving or dying and not
being able to retrieve your precious items. This pack is a balanced magic/tech pack which will give you a well rounded "different" experience
to the normal large modpacks that are out there. If you're interested in joining us and playing on the Australian hosted server you can apply
on our website.

If you have any issues please refer to the github.
